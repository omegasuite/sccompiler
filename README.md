# sccompiler

This is a simple compiler for SC. (Small C or Smart Contract)

SC is a C-like language for Omega Chain Smart Contracts. The compiler will translate SC program into 
OVM (Omega Virtual Machine) assembly code. See http://omegasuite.org/omega/files/ovmasmspec.html for
assembly spec and http://omegasuite.org/omega/files/ovmbcspec.html for VM code spec.

To further translate assembly code to VM code, use http://omegasuite.org/omega/assemble.php.
